## What Works
- Markdown to MP3 conversion with XTTS-v2
- Windows context menu integration
- Text cleaning and chunking
- Reference voice support
- Automatic Downloads folder detection
- Large file processing
- Audio quality with XTTS-v2

## What's Left to Build
- Progress indicators during conversion
- Enhanced error handling
- Performance optimizations
- User feedback collection
- Documentation updates

## Current Status
- Core functionality is complete and working
- XTTS-v2 integration is successful
- Context menu integration is functional
- Basic error handling is in place
- Ready for regular use

## Known Issues
- No progress feedback during conversion
- Limited error handling for edge cases

## Evolution of Project Decisions
1. Initial TTS model → XTTS-v2 for better quality
2. Direct file modification → Preserve original files
3. Single file processing → Chunk-based processing
4. Fixed output location → Dynamic Downloads folder
5. Basic TTS → Reference voice support
